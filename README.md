ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kstoumpos
I have been working as a developer for the last five of years, I enjoy programming very much and would like to have the chance to work, 
in a competitive environment to further improve my skills and meet new people. 
During my carrier, I was given the opportunity to work many times with my colleagues on a variety of team projects. 
In the university, I had the chance to work with younger students, while voluntarily doing auxiliary work in laboratories and helping them with their homework. 
While working as a developer, very often I have to cooperate with people with different educational backgrounds (managers, designers), 
and thus a different approach on daily issues. This can be very challenging, but very educative at the same time. 
To conclude, I believe that I can work very efficiently with my co-workers under various circumstances.
